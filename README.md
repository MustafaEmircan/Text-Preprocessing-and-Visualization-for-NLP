# Text Preprocessing and Visualization for NLP 🧠📊

## BUSINESS PROBLEM  
A dataset containing Wikipedia texts will be analyzed through text preprocessing and visualization techniques. The goal is to clean the texts, remove unnecessary words, and calculate word frequencies. 
These results will be presented through various visualization methods to highlight important patterns and insights within the texts.

## TO DO:
- Clean and preprocess the text data 🔄  
- Remove stop words and rare words 🧹  
- Tokenize and lemmatize the texts 🔠  
- Calculate word frequencies and generate visualizations 📊🌈  

## FEATURES
- **Text**: The full content of each Wikipedia article 📝  

## DATASET STORY  
The dataset consists of a collection of Wikipedia articles, where each entry contains the full text of an article. The task is to clean and preprocess this text to extract useful insights, 
calculate the frequency of words, and visualize the key information.

## ANALYSES MADE:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Removed stop words, punctuation, and unnecessary characters from the texts 🧹  
- **Tokenization**: Split the cleaned text into individual tokens (words) for further analysis 🔠  
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Counted the frequency of words across all texts to identify the most common and relevant words 🔢  
- **Visualization**: Created visualizations such as word clouds, bar charts, and histograms to represent word distributions and key patterns 📊🌈  

## TOOLS & TECHNIQUES USED:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling the dataset  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations and presenting insights 🎨📊  
- **NLP Preprocessing Libraries**: Used NLTK and SpaCy for efficient text preprocessing and tokenization 🛠️  

## ABOUT THE DATA  
This dataset contains Wikipedia articles, each with rich text content. The primary objective is to preprocess these texts and analyze the most important words or phrases, 
while visualizing the results in a user-friendly manner.
